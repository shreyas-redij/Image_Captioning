**Overview**
- Hybrid system employing the use of multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract feature form the images and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to accurately structure meaningful sentences using the generated keywords
- Decoder compares target image with large dataset and generate accurate description.
- The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using standard evaluation matrices such as BLUE score.
